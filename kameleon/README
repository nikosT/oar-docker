This kameleon recipe is not in sync with kameleon recipes (github).

It creates a docker image with a specified version (need to be incremented for the oardocker upgrade process)

To generate a new one:
- modify recipes/steps
- increment the version number
- run make 

Once the build is OK:
- make push
This uploads to dockerhub website (need to have access to the dockerhub oardocker account)
